Major restaurant brands like KFC face significant losses due to theft. The issue arises when a driver accepts a food delivery request, picks up the order, and then cancels without starting the trip. Currently, thereâ€™s no way to verify that the driver received the food. This is where my application addresses the problem.

I am still developing the app and plan to integrate AI features. A FACE API will help identify drivers committing fraud, allowing us to block them from picking up food at all participating restaurants. The backend of the application is built using C# and SQL Server.
